## Getting Started With Dolby.io Plugins
Dolby.io is Dolby's developer platform, providing APIs, SDKs, and Game Engine Plugins that allow developers to build compelling audio and video experiences. This event will be primarily focused around the Dolby.io Spatial Chat plugins for Unity and Unreal. The Dolby.io team is eager to get your feedback on using and understanding the plugins so please chat to the team if you run into any issues or blockers.

## Dolbyio Prize Requirements and Event Logistics

**Prizes:** Prizes will be given in a variety of audio-related categories, recognising great games and other quirky achievements (sponsored by Dolby Australia). Please note, prizes will be awarded to to UTS Students only.

**Theme:** Core topics will be provided on the day of the Game Jam for teams to design and build their game around. This ensures that all teams come to event with a blank canvas, ready to collaborate on any creative design ideas that are inspired by the themes of the day.

>Theme will be added here once announced

**Team Sizes:** There is no minimum or maximum team size, however we recommend teams of 2-5 people. You can come with a pre-made team but there will also be time to form new teams and recruit new team members on the first day. This is a chance to work with people you usually wouldn‚Äôt get the chance to, so make the most of it and get to know others at the event.

## Workshop: Getting Started with Dolby.io and the Dolby.io Spatial Chat Plugin for Unity

1. Created a Dolby.io Account.
2. Opened Unity and created a new project from the 3rd person template.
3. Downloaded the scripts from the [Workshop Scripts folder](https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/hackathon-quick-start/tree/main/UTSGamesJam2023/Workshop%20Scripts).
