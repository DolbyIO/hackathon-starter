# Thought Starters
Analyze API - look up things like media file duration, file type, loudness level, audio classification (music, speech, silence)
Transcode API - create variations of format for media so soundtracks on soundcloud, streaming media online, or use in film can be achieved
Music Mastering API - for new compositions that are not already using professional tools
Comms SDK - collaborate with other people in discussing the project
