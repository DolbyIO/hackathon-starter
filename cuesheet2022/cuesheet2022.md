For this hackathon we are focusing on the APIs and SDKs that you can find on https://dolby.io/ 

# Thought Starters

Here are some ideas for how you might use a Dolby.io API or SDK in your project.

## [Media APIs](https://docs.dolby.io/media-apis/docs)

*Support media workflows to analyze, transcode, master and enhance file-based media to improve the quality of audience experiences.*

- [Analyze API](https://docs.dolby.io/media-apis/docs/analyze-api-guide) - Look up things like media file duration, file type, loudness level, audio classification (music, speech, silence).
- [Transcode API](https://docs.dolby.io/media-apis/docs/transcode-api-guide) - Create variations of format for media so soundtracks on soundcloud, streaming media online, or use in film can be achieved.
- [Music Mastering API](https://docs.dolby.io/media-apis/docs/music-mastering-api-guide) - For new compositions that are not already using professional tools.
- [Enhance API](https://docs.dolby.io/media-apis/docs/enhance-api-guide) - Correct audio defects such as noise or hum.

Media API content that can help you get started:
- [Sampling Excerpts of Media to Determine Ideal Enhance Parameters](https://dolby.io/blog/sampling-excerpts-of-media-to-determine-ideal-enhance-parameters/)

## [Communications APIs](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs)

*Add HD voice and video for fully immersive real-time communications and streaming projects.*

- [Developer SDKs](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/overview-developer-tools) - Build out fully functional video-audio conference appications for Web, Android, and iOS.
- [Dolby Voice](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/guides-dolby-voice) - Add realtime noise correction and speaker isolation to your conference application.
- [Spatial Audio](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/guides-spatial-audio) - Add spatial audio functionality to your conference application.
